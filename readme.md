## Introduction

Some time ago i created `Folder Icons Changer`.\
The program to customize folders on windows,\
but the program is always detect as virus.\
And i can not fix it, so ...

### `I have closed this project`

I leave releases and code on branch `old`.\
But on `master` i leave `all my icons`.

## Further

I like my icons and in free time\
i would have created new icons, so ...\
`Some new icons will be appear`.\
I hope...
